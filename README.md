# Laundary_WebServices
We create a web application for a laundry service that streamlines the user experience.  explore available services, add items to the cart, and book appointments seamlessly. Additionally, the application should send an email to your email address providing the details of the order placed by the user using email.js  when the user clicks on Book Now.
